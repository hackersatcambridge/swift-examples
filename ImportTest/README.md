# ImportTest
This program simply serves as an example of how to import packages. Here we're going to import the Hackers at Cambridge example [Primes package](https://github.com/hackersatcambridge/primes-swift-package)

# Usage
To run this program, first clone it. Then go to the directory you cloned it to and run `swift build`. Swift should then tell you where it has built the executable. You can then run this executable. e.g.:

```
$ swift build
Compile Swift Module 'Primes' (1 sources)
Compile Swift Module 'ImportTest' (1 sources)
Linking ./.build/debug/ImportTest
$ ./.build/debug/ImportTest
Checking if 17 is prime...
true
```
